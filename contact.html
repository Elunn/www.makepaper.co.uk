                <p>Hi, I'm Elliot</p>
                <p>FORMiT is the outcome from my final year at Falmouth University studying Sustainable product design. I am a maker at heart and I hope this shows in my FORMiT project. Paper has always been my go to medium and I am passionate about sustainability, these are main driving factors of this project. My hope is for FORMiT to inspire people to use paper in creative ways</p>           
                <p>I am interested to know what this tool can do, so if you wish to collaborate or have any suggestions do get in contact. Currently this website consists of the "make" page, but I hope to add an "explore" page, where I will share the process of getting to this point and everything I have manged to make with FORMiT!</p>
